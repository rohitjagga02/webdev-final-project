<p>Understanding how fluids flow and interact with their environment is an extensive field of research in applied mathematics. Equally important to this understanding is the mathematical modeling of the physical phenomena and the mathematical solution method used.</p>
<p>Fluid flow is governed by complicated nonlinear systems of partial differential equations. In many situations of interest the flow spans a huge range of length scales, with the nonlinearity of the governing equations resulting in the transfer of energy from one length scale to another. Because of this complexity, the field of fluid mechanics has been the birth place of many important ideas in mathematics.</p>
