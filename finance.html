<p>Increasingly, financial institutions, investment banks, and commodities firms rely upon highly sophisticated mathematical models to identify, measure, and manage risk. These models require professionals with extensive skills in both finance and mathematics.</p>
<p>With increasing complication in predicting stocks and new methods such as high-frequency trading, companies require an ever-higher amount of applied mathematics to develop more profitable models. That's the reason why new trading firms like DE Shaw and Two Sigma are starting to dominate Wall Street!</p>
